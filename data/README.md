#farm: Name of farm where data were collected. "Anderson"=Kaleb Andersons; "Honken"=Dan Honken
#season: season that data were collected. "Spring", "Summer", "Fall" followed by year data were collected
#biomass: biomass component measured. "Forage" is the vegetative IWG harvested in spring or fall prior to, or after grazing; "Grain" is grain at maturity; "Straw" is biomass residue remaining after grain harvest
#plot: Unique identification number for the area in the field where the sample was taken. Three plots were enclosed (not grazed) and three were open to grazing, per paddock
#trt: Indicating whether or not the area that was sampled was accessible to grazing. "Enclosed" indicates that the area was fenced and not accessible; "Grazed" indicates that the area was grazed.
#paddock: Region of the farm, three per farm
#pregraze_g: grams of vegetative biomass harvested from the quadrat prior to grazing - and indicator of forage availability
#pregraze_mg_ha: Conversion of pregraze_g sample mass per unit area to metric tonnes per hectare
#pregraze_tons_acre: Converting pregraze sample to tons per acre
#postgraze_g: grams of vegetative biomass harvested from the quadrat after to grazing - an indication of what was left after grazing, used for grazing efficiency
#postgraze_mg_ha: Conversion of postgraze_g sample mass per unit area to metric tonnes per hectare
#postgraze_tons_acre: Converting postgraze sample to tons per acre
#fifference_mg_ha: Difference in pregraze and post graze biomass in metric tonnes per ha
#perc_grazed: propotion of pregraze biomass removed during grazing
#CP: crude protein measured in % dry matter
#ADF: Acid detergent fiber measured in % dry matter
#NDF: Neutral detergent fiber measured in % dry matter
#RFV: Relative feed value; add equation here -
